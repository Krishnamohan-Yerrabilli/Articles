## All you need to know about Amazon Route 53

### Route 53

#### Definition

AWS Route 53 is simply a domain name service offered by Amazon web services, 
Its job is to take the user's requested Domain name example: 'aws.amazon.com' and 
convert into numerical IP address example: '10.72.171.77' and route to the allocated 
host(EC2) via ELB.

Amazon launched this service in 2010, it supports services that are tightly integrated
with aws, to understand better we need to understand some concepts behind it, below
I explained some of the terminologies.

### Cloud Terminologies 

#### Regions

![8aws.jpg](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657163987470/q0dOnlCZ7.jpg align="center")

Regions are the physical locations that have multiple clusters of data centers,
these locations are foundations for allocating hosts to data transfers the requested
resources from the customer, these regions are combined with AZ's

#### AZ's

These are called Availability zones which are concise in a particular region, these
zones purpose is to store applications data, multiple AZ's are helpful because they
can protect our application data from disaster recovery, fault tolerance, single point
failure, etc, etc...,  

Availability zones have a count of a minimum of 3 in a region and a maximum of 6 in a Region

#### Elastic Compute Cloud

These are also called EC2 Instances which are one of the main blocks of AWS, these are 
simply servers located in AWS data centers that offer multiple resources, such
as storage, compute, and networking.

In the cloud, you may hear of Infrastructure as a service aka IAAS and this is what it is.  

#### S3 Buckets

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657165712124/KkvE4SVzO.png align="center")

These are amazon storage services and this is one of the main concepts in AWS, 
Buckets are referred to as containers that can be designed to store objects.

Objects are simply types of data you store, in S3 everything refers to objects,
and S3 is a global service, but you want to create these services region-based. 

Bucket names must be unique, because of their usage, and to identify easily, each
bucket name assigned to individual aws customers.

#### Elastic Load Balancer

These are called ELB, its purpose is to balance the application load to different EC2 instances 
Its better use case works under a micro-service architecture (which we see in another article) 
soon.

When a user requests the website (either static or dynamic) Imagine your application has got
10000 requests per second, the ELB work is to check the healthy EC2 instances and distributed
These requests are equally divided among multiple instances. 

#### CloudFront

For info please go through the below article, I clearly explained what is CloudFront.

### What is Route 53?

AWS Route 53 is a (Domain name system) web service, which is specially designed to manage
cloud applications are hosted on the AWS cloud, and it is route end-users to applications.

which they requested, Route 53 takes the domain name address and converts it into a computer 
an understandable language called IP address which is a way to identify a specific website that is
hosted on the AWS server.

### Routing Policies

These are simply a set of guidelines on how to route the requests from the user, 
we have different types of routing policies that are mostly used.

### Types of Routing Policies

#### Simple Routing Policy

This works across regions and it is a default routing policy that forwards the routing 
request without taking the health of the resources into consideration.

#### Weighted Routing Policy

It is based on specifications, I mean every instance is weighted( giving a certain percent 
of requests for each instance ) by you, then these requests go according to your proportions 
which you weighted.

When testing an application, performing like user acceptance as the application is available
 to only a few sets of users, want this policy will definitely help.

#### Latency Routing Policy

This works on how fastly the user gets the response back from the resource, it is calculated
 under what is the best route which takes the fast latency route into consideration.

#### Failover Routing Policy

When the request is going to the primary instance, in case of primary instance may fall
it happens in many cases in that case it considers a break(fall) of an instance, then this
the request is forward to a healthy
instance

### Key Benefits

#### Traffic Flow

It is an editor where an AWS customer can visualize how the data passes from user to
 the endpoint it is a feature offered by Route-53

We can easily switch back through different policy rules (retrieve back to the previous
 policy) and it has 4 types of rules which are 

- Geo-location
- Latency
- Fail-over
- Weighted

#### Health Checks

Checks are performed before the traffic entered the resource(instance), If only all checks 
are passed like fail-over or any other reason, which leads to an un-requested response
 from the server, It routes the request into a healthy instance. 

#### Alias Records

This is one of the most foundational concepts in Route53, It maps the request to a specific 
resource while serving the request which resource it wants to go through an example: S3, 
Cloudfront, DB etc, etc..,

### How It works?

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657167460210/4BA4Vq-ta.png align="left")

To perform the job, obviously, it wants to go through a series of steps, this happens when
 a user request access to a web server through Route 53

- The user access an address through route 53 that is managed by the host machine here
 address is nothing but a website address (www.google.com)

- Next step is managed by the user ISP or any local network, the user receives the request
 DNS resolver by Route 53, and the request is forwarded to the root server (consider the 
the backbone of the internet).

- Then the request is forward to the TLD aka Top-level-domain by the DNS resolver

- The DNS resolver acquires the info from authorized Route 53 4 name servers(translates
 the domain name into IP address) which helps to find the requested host, and which 
 resources it wants to be forwarded. 

- It selects one of the four authorized name servers and requests the resource that we need.

- This request is acquired by route 53, and sent a request to the DNS, to find the relevant
web-page resources that are requested by Route 53, after it successfully finds out its hands
 the information to the DNS resolver.

- Here a TTL (Time to Live) parameter has been attached to the response, after the
 successful acquisition the data is stored in the local isp cache and in the web browser
 cache.

- The requested web page has been downloaded into a web browser and shows it. 

### Alternatives to Route 53

Here we have a lot of choices some of them are: 

- Google Cloud DNS
- Azure DNS
- Go Daddy premium
- Cloudflare DNS
