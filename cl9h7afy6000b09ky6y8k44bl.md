# Getting started with Kubernetes Namespaces

It's crucial to understand that Kubernetes namespaces are not the <br> same as Linux kernel namespaces. 

Kernel and Namespaces divide operating systems into virtual operating <br> systems called containers.  

Kubernetes Namespaces Divide Kubernetes cluster into virtual clusters, <br>which you might call Namespaces. 

Before we dive into Namespaces, First, let's understand some terms.

## Terminologies

### Container 

A container is nothing but a ready-made software package 
that contains everything needed to run an app from code to application<be> 

system libraries, default values ‚Äã‚Äãfor required settings, and any runtime it needs A<br> container
holds everything.

###  Cluster 

Each container runs on a cluster. It consists of a 
Control plane and computer machine nodes. 

### The control plane 

Takes care of the applications running on 
the cluster and the resources they use, while the nodes are the 
machines on which the clusters run.

### Orchestration 

Ever seen an orchestra? The orchestra conductor decides what <br>
sound he wants, how many violins, how many trumpets, what octave 
and everything else. 

Similarly, orchestration determines which container to use <br>
which resources to use, which application to run, etc.

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) comes from the Greek word meaning
sailing master or pilot. Simply put, it means a person who <br>
has substantial control over operations. 

This is what Kubernetes does. 

It manages clusters, their deployment, scaling, etc.

Now let's dig into ‚ÄúKubernetes Namespaces‚Äù

## Kubernetes Namespaces 'N' 

So What is Kubernetes Namespace?

With the help of Namespaces, each cluster is divided into virtual sub-clusters.

Each team can work in a Namespace without disturbing others.<br>
An application and its dependencies are stored in Namespaces in a cluster.

These Namespaces are separate from each other but are allowed to communicate <br>
with each other.

It's Namespaces that allow projects and team members to share a cluster.

Let us understand this by comparing how things have changed <br>
and how these technologies are evolving

The process by which application development takes place.

Earlier resource allocation was a problem. An application consumes a <br>
a lot of resources

This causes other applications to underperform. Organizations cannot <br>
afford to deploy multiple physical servers.

## üñß Virtualization and Containers  


![vm image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664821569769/HBV1pvqwa.png align="center")

This is where the concept of virtualization came into the picture and <br>
provided a viable solution to the above problem.

With the help of virtualization software, it is possible to run multiple <br>
virtual machines on a single CPU.

This has saved organizations from the additional costs of purchasing <br>
and maintaining additional hardware.

Virtualization also provides scalability as resources can be added <br>
or removed at any time without disturbing other VMs. 

It also demonstrated improved security as the VM was not accessed by other VMs.

This is the age of Kubernetes, where containers simplify application <br>
development and make the whole process much simpler.

These containers are similar to virtual machines but are lighter. <br>
They relax discrete features as they can be shared across multiple <br>
os, have their own CPU space, memory, etc., <br>
and they are isolated from their respective infrastructure.


## Types of Kubernetes Namespaces

While writing this blog (Oct 3/ 2022) Kubernetes has four Namespaces, <br>
this may change in future

### default

it has a default Namespace for objects that have no other Namespace.

- Pod
- Services      
- Deployment...
      
### kube-system

Namespace for Kubernetes system-derived objects.

- Kube-DNS
- Holds master process
- kubectl process

### kube-public

This Namespace is used for resources that should be publicly available<br> 
to all users.

 - Cluster-info
 - ConfigMap

### kube-nodelease

Used to track the health of the node

- Allocated to each node(object) 

## Default Namespace

This is a Namespace automatically created by Kubernetes.
This Namespace includes pods, services, and deployment
Can be accessed by every user (even unauthenticated ones).

## Viewing Namespaces

You can see your current Namespaces using the following command:

```
kubectl get namespaces
```

This lists your current Namespaces, their status, etc.

Command to get more info about a particular Namespace

```
Get Kubectl Namespaces 
```

We can also get a detailed description of a specific Namespace by using <br>
the following command:

```
Kubectl describes the Namespace 
```

Description Shows resource quota (if specified) and resource range, A <br>
resource quota shows the total resources a Namespace can use, <br>
And the resource range shows the minimum or maximum resources that can be consumed.

It also shows whether the Namespace is active or terminating. These are <br>
the two designations of any Namespace. 

The active Namespace is in current use, while the terminating Namespace<br> 
is being dropped and is no longer in use.


## Creating a New Namespace

We can create a new Namespace in two ways:

### Imperative way

->  You can simply run the command: 

```
kubectl create Namespace 
```

### Declarative way

We can also create a YAML file with the following contents: 

Newspace.yaml:

```
kind: Namespace
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: newspace
labels:
name: newspace
```


```
kubectl apply-f newspace.yaml
```

It is easy to create a new Namespace.

ü§î How to share a cluster with Namespaces? 

A Namespace allows teams to share a Kubernetes cluster
it allows you to create Virtual cluster's inside the existing [cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/)

Although your current environment is not changed to your new namespace <br>
it's time-consuming and also not efficient to type --namespace with<br> 
kubectl command always

Let's see a simple hack, how you can switch your current default Namespace <br>
to your preferred Namespace

## Hack to switch between Namespaces

The command to view Namespaces

```
kubens
```

To switch Namespaces 

```
kubens newspace
```
That's it, now all your commands only work within your  `newspace` Namespace

How to switch back, it's so simple

```
kubens default
```
## Deleting a Namespace

Delete any particular Namespace by using this command:

```
Kubectl delete Namespace 
```

After the command is executed, Namespace will pop up a ‚ÄúTerminating‚Äù <br>
status for a while.

Congratulations Now, you can create, view, or delete Namespaces. 

## Why Should You Use Kubernetes Namespaces? 

it's time to understand why Kubernetes Namespaces are crucial and <br>
what are their advantages:

A Namespace is used by a specific team, which increases the sense of<br> 
accountability through better role-based access control.

Namespaces allow teams to work in their respective bubbles without<br> 
interfering with and disrupting others.

With Namespaces, it is possible to carry out the development, testing, and<br> 
production of applications in different containers.

A resource quota divides the number of resources that users and teams <br>
can use.

## Using multiple Namespaces 

In smaller organizations, where development, testing, and production <br>
teams work side by side, the default Namespace is sufficient. 

Development and testing do not require isolation and, therefore, can <br>
work with a single default Namespace.

But if the team is large or expanding day by day, multiple Namespaces <br>
will be required. 

## Use-case of multiple Namespaces 

Development and testing can be clustered as one team, and production <br>
can be isolated so that any changes made by development and testing do not <br>
affect production. 

Throughout the entire lifecycle of the application, both teams can work in <br>
their respective Namespaces.
